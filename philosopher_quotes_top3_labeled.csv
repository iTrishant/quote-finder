The 'kingdom of Heaven' is a condition of the heart - not something that comes 'upon the earth' or 'after death.',Friedrich Nietzsche,"('death', 'god', 'heart')"

Deep is the well of truth and long does it take to know what has fallen into its depths.,Friedrich Nietzsche,"('knowledge', 'spirituality', 'truth')"

"What we do is never understood, but always merely praised or blamed.",Friedrich Nietzsche,"('philosophy', 'spiritual', 'wisdom')"
"The strong individual loves the earth so much he lusts for recurrence. He can smile in the face of the most terrible thought: meaningless, aimless existence recurring eternally. The second characteristic of such a man is that he has the strength to recognize - and to live with the recognition - that the world is valueless in itself and that all values are human ones. He creates himself by fashioning his own values; he has the pride to live by the values he wills.",Friedrich Nietzsche,"('love', 'man', 'nature')"

"I observed once to Goethe that when a friend is with us we do not think the same of him as when he is away.

Every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world.,Arthur Schopenhauer Quotes,"('inspirational', 'philosophy', 'world')"
"The real meaning of persona is a mask, such as actors were accustomed to wear on the ancient stage; and it is quite true that no one shows himself as he is, but wears his mask and plays his part.

"If God made the world, I would not be that God, for the misery of the world would break my heart.",Arthur Schopenhauer Quotes,"('god', 'joy', 'religion')"
"What disturbs and depresses young people is the hunt for happiness on the firm assumption that it must be met with in life. From this arises constantly deluded hope and so also dissatisfaction.

"The greatest wisdom is to make the enjoyment of the present the supreme object of life; because that is the only reality, all else being merely the play of thought.

"Genius is its own reward; for the best that one is, one must necessarily be for oneself. . . . Further, genius consists in the working of the free intellect., and as a consequence the productions of genius serve no useful purpose.

To be useless and unprofitable is one of the characteristics of genius; it is their patent of nobility.",Arthur Schopenhauer Quotes,"('inspirational', 'intelligence', 'knowledge')"
Life without pain has no meaning.,Arthur Schopenhauer Quotes,"('inspirational', 'life', 'pain')"
"Students and scholars of all kinds and of every age aim, as a rule, only at information, not insight.

Hatred is an affair of the heart; contempt that of the head.,Arthur Schopenhauer Quotes,"('heart', 'love', 'wisdom')"
"Suicide may also be regarded as an experiment - a question which man puts to Nature, trying to force her to answer.

Life is a business that does not cover the costs.,Arthur Schopenhauer Quotes,"('life', 'money', 'motivationalquotes')"
"The art of not reading is a very important one. It consists in not taking an interest in whatever may be engaging the attention of the general public at any particular time. When some political or ecclesiastical pamphlet, or novel, or poem is making a great commotion, you should remember that he who writes for fools always finds a large public. A precondition for reading good books is not reading bad ones: for life is short.",Arthur Schopenhauer Quotes,"('art', 'books', 'reading')"

"The reason domestic pets are so lovable and so helpful to us is because they enjoy, quietly and placidly, the present moment.",Arthur Schopenhauer Quotes,"('humor', 'love', 'trust')"
"However, for the man who studies to gain insight, books and studies are merely rungs of the ladder on which he climbs to the summit of knowledge. As soon as a rung has raised him up one step, he leaves it behind. On the other hand, the many who study in order to fill their memory do not use the rungs of the ladder for climbing, but take them off and load themselves with them to take away, rejoicing at the increasing weight of the burden. They remain below forever, because they bear what should have bourne them.",Arthur Schopenhauer Quotes,"('books', 'reading', 'science')"
No greater mistake can be made than to imagine that what has been written latest is always the more correct; that what is written later on is an improvement on what was written previously; and that every change means progress.,Arthur Schopenhauer Quotes,"('change', 'leadership', 'writing')"
"Our civilized world is nothing but a great masquerade. You encounter knights, parsons, soldiers, doctors, lawyers, priests, philosophers and a thousand more: but they are not what they appear - they are merely masks...

Our first ideas of life are generally taken from fiction rather than fact.,Arthur Schopenhauer Quotes,"('life', 'reality', 'science')"
"If the lives of men were relieved of all need, hardship and adversity; if everything they took in hand were successful, they would be so swollen with arrogance that, though they might not burst, they would present the spectacle of unbridled folly-nay, they would go mad.

"Intellect is a magnitude of intensity, not a magnitude of extensity.",Arthur Schopenhauer Quotes,"('intelligence', 'science', 'wisdom')"
"Just as one spoils the stomach by overfeeding and thereby impairs the whole body, so can one overload and choke the mind by giving it too much nourishment. For the more one reads the fewer are the traces left of what one has read; the mind is like a tablet that has been written over and over. Hence it is impossible to reflect; and it is only by reflection that one can assimilate what one has read. If one reads straight ahead without pondering over it later, what has been read does not take root, but is for the most part lost.",Arthur Schopenhauer Quotes,"('books', 'reading', 'writing')"
"There are two things which make it impossible to believe that this world is the successful work of an all-wise, all-good, and at the same time, all-powerful being; firstly, the misery which abounds in it everywhere; and secondly, the obvious imperfection of its highest product, man, who is a burlesque of what he should be.",Arthur Schopenhauer Quotes,"('happiness', 'inspirational', 'world')"

We seldom speak of what we have but often of what we lack.,Arthur Schopenhauer Quotes,"('freedom', 'life', 'words')"
"It would be better if there were nothing.

"There is only one inborn erroneous notion ... that we exist in order to be happy ... So long as we persist in this inborn error ... the world seems to us full of contradictions.

Restlessness is the hallmark of existence.,Arthur Schopenhauer Quotes,"('life', 'purpose', 'writing')"
"Man may have the most excellent judgment in all other matters, and yet go wrong in those which concern himself; because here the will comes in and deranges the intellect at once.

"Animals learn death first at the moment of death;...man approaches death with the knowledge it is closer every hour, and this creates a feeling of uncertainty over his life, even for him who forgets in the business of life that annihilation is awaiting him. It is for this reason chiefly that we have philosophy and religion.",Arthur Schopenhauer Quotes,"('death', 'learning', 'life')"

"Because Christian morality leaves animals out of account, they are at once outlawed in philosophical morals; they are mere 'things,' mere means to any ends whatsoever. They can therefore be used for vivisection, hunting, coursing, bullfights, and horse racing, and can be whipped to death as they struggle along with heavy carts of stone.

"The life of God - the life which the mind apprehends and enjoys as it rises to the absolute unity of all things - may be described as a play of love with itself; but this idea sinks to an edifying truism, or even to a platitude, when it does not embrace in it the earnestness, the pain, the patience, and labor, involved in the negative aspect of things.",Hegel,"('god', 'life', 'light')"

But I maintain that in such a case an action of this kind, however proper, however amiable it may be, has nevertheless no true moral worth, but is on a level with other inclinations. . . . For the maxim lacks the moral import, namely, that such actions be done from duty, not from inclination.",Immanuel Kant,"('christianity', 'politics', 'sex')"
"I feel a complete thirst for knowledge and an eager unrest to go further in it as well as satisfaction at every acquisition.

When you live alone you no longer know what it is to tell a story: the plausible disappears at the same time as the friends.

Beauty has no obvious use; nor is there any clear cultural necessity for it. Yet civilization could not do without it.,Sigmund Freud,"('beauty', 'philosophy', 'society')"
"Indeed, the great Leonardo (da Vinci) remained like a child for the whole of his life in more than one way. It is said that all great men are bound to retain some infantile part. Even as an adult he continued to play, and this was another reason why he often appeared uncanny and incomprehensible to his contemporaries.",Sigmund Freud,"('children', 'future', 'great')"
Dreams are constructed from the residue of yesterday.,Sigmund Freud,"('dreams', 'future', 'time')"

"If there are quarrels between the parents or if their marriage is unhappy, the ground will be prepared in their children for the severest predisposition to a disturbance of sexual development or to neurotic illness.",Sigmund Freud,"('children', 'family', 'marriage')"
"When making a decision of minor importance, I have always found it advantageous to consider all the pros and cons. In vital matters, however, such as the choice of a mate or a profession, the decision should come from the unconscious, from somewhere within ourselves. In the important decisions of personal life, we should be governed, I think, by the deep inner needs of our nature.",Sigmund Freud,"('life', 'mind', 'time')"
Religious ideas have sprung from the same need as all the other achievements of culture: from the necessity for defending itself against the crushing supremacy of nature.,Sigmund Freud,"('christianity', 'nature', 'religion')"
"Men are not gentle, friendly creatures wishing for love, who simply defend themselves if they are attacked, but ... a powerful measure of desire for aggression had to be reckoned as part of their instinctual endowment.",Sigmund Freud,"('love', 'men', 'women')"
A civilization which leaves so large a number of its participants unsatisfied and drives them into revolt neither has nor deserves the prospect of a lasting existence.,Sigmund Freud,"('life', 'politics', 'society')"
"The ego refuses to be distressed by the provocations of reality, to let itself be compelled to suffer. It insists that it cannot be affected by the traumas of the external world; it shows, in fact, that such traumas are no more than occasions for it to gain pleasure.",Sigmund Freud,"('pain', 'reality', 'spiritual')"
We must not allow ourselves to be deflected by the feminists who are anxious to force us to regard the two sexes as completely equal in position and worth.,Sigmund Freud,"('beauty', 'men', 'women')"
"A poor girl may have an illusion that a prince will come and fetch her home. It is possible, some such cases have occurred. That the Messiah will come and found a golden age is much less probable.",Sigmund Freud,"('children', 'love', 'women')"
A hero is a man who stands up manfully against his father and in the end victoriously overcomes him.,Sigmund Freud,"('inspirational', 'man', 'wisdom')"
"I am actually not at all a man of science, not an observer, not an experimenter, not a thinker. I am by temperament nothing but a conquistador",Sigmund Freud,"('man', 'science', 'time')"
"Instinct of love toward an object demands a mastery to obtain it, and if a person feels they can't control the object or feel threatened by it, they act negatively toward it.",Sigmund Freud,"('art', 'love', 'spirituality')"
"There is a psychological technique which makes it possible to interpret dreams, and ... if that procedure is employed, every dream reveals itself as a psychical structure which has a meaning and which can be inserted at an assignable point in the mental activities of waking life.",Sigmund Freud,"('dreams', 'life', 'reality')"
I no longer count as one of my merits that I always tell the truth as much as possible; it has become my metier.,Sigmund Freud,"('man', 'truth', 'words')"
"So in every individual the two trends, one towards personal happiness and the other unity with the rest of humanity, must contend with each other.",Sigmund Freud,"('change', 'happiness', 'life')"
"Every normal person, in fact, is only normal on the average. His ego approximates to that of the psychotic in some part or other and to a greater or lesser extent.",Sigmund Freud,"('history', 'humanity', 'self')"
"We find a place for what we lose. Although we know that after such a loss the acute stage of mourning will subside, we also know that we shall remain inconsolable and will never find a substitute.

Religion (is) a universal obsessional neurosis.,Sigmund Freud,"('belief', 'philosophy', 'religion')"

Love and work are the cornerstones of our humanness.,Sigmund Freud,"('humanity', 'love', 'work')"
There is no likelihood of our being able to suppress humanity's aggressive tendencies... Complete suppression of man's aggressive tendencies is not an issue; what we may try is to direct it into a channel other than that of warfare.,Sigmund Freud,"('leadership', 'man', 'war')"

"There is a powerful force within us, an un-illuminated part of the mind - separate from the conscious mind that is constantly at work molding our thought, feelings, and actions.",Sigmund Freud,"('love', 'mind', 'power')"
"A layman will no doubt find it hard to understand how pathological disorders of the body and mind can be eliminated by 'mere' words. He will feel that he is being asked to believe in magic. And he will not be so very wrong, for the words which we use in our everyday speech are nothing other than watered-down magic. But we shall have to follow a roundabout path in order to explain how science sets about restoring to words a part at least of their former magical power.",Sigmund Freud,"('funny', 'science', 'words')"
I had thought about cocaine in a kind of day-dream.,Sigmund Freud,"('great', 'life', 'power')"
Cigars served me for precisely fifty years as protection and a weapon in the combat of life... I owe to the cigar a great intensification of my capacity to work and a facilitation of my self-control.,Sigmund Freud,"('god', 'life', 'passion')"
What we call happiness in the strictest sense comes from the (preferably sudden) satisfaction of needs which have been dammed up to a high degree.,Sigmund Freud,"('happiness', 'life', 'success')"
The virtuous man contents himself with dreaming that which the wicked man does in actual life.,Sigmund Freud,"('dreams', 'life', 'man')"
"Philosophers stretch the meaning of words until they retain scarcely anything of their original sense. They give the name of ""God"" to some vague abstraction which they have created for themselves; having done so they can pose before all the world as deists, as believers of God, and they can even boast that they have recognized a higher, purer concept of God, notwithstanding that their God is not nothing more than an insubstantial shadow and no longer the mighty personality of religious doctrines.",Sigmund Freud,"('christianity', 'god', 'religion')"
What a distressing contrast there is between the radiant intelligence of the child and the feeble mentality of the average adult.,Sigmund Freud,"('children', 'courage', 'intelligence')"
The idea of life having a purpose stands and falls with the religious system.,Sigmund Freud,"('life', 'purpose', 'religion')"

"In the important decisions of personal life, we should be governed by the deep inner needs of our nature.",Sigmund Freud,"('life', 'reality', 'spirituality')"
A strong experience in the present awakens in the creative writer a memory of an earlier experience (usually belonging to his childhood) from which there now proceeds a wish which finds its fulfilment in the creative work.,Sigmund Freud,"('inspirational', 'poetry', 'writing')"

Talk therapy turns hysterical misery to mundane unhappiness.,Sigmund Freud,"('life', 'pain', 'writing')"
In human beings pure masculinity or femininity is not to be found either in a psychological or biological sense.,Sigmund Freud,"('self', 'sex', 'women')"
"Religion restricts the play of choice and adaptation, since it imposes equally on everyone its own path to the acquisition of happiness and protection from suffering. Its technique consists in depressing the value of life and distorting the picture of the real world in a delusional manner - which presupposes an intimidation of the intelligence. At this price, by forcibly fixing them in a state of psychical infantilism and by drawing them into a mass-delusion, religion succeeds in sparing many people an individual neurosis. But hardly anything more.",Sigmund Freud,"('belief', 'religion', 'spirituality')"
"When making a decision of minor importance, I have always found it advantageous to consider all the pros and cons.",Sigmund Freud,"('me', 'successquotes', 'time')"

"In matters of sexuality we are at present, every one of us, ill or well, nothing but hypocrites.",Sigmund Freud,"('men', 'sex', 'women')"
"Properly speaking, the unconscious is the real psychic; its inner nature is just as unknown to us as the reality of the external world, and it is just as imperfectly reported to us through the data of consciousness as is the external world through the indications of our sensory organs.",Sigmund Freud,"('reality', 'soul', 'spirituality')"
"It is a predisposition of human nature to consider an unpleasant idea untrue, and then it is easy to find arguments against it.",Sigmund Freud,"('philosophy', 'truth', 'women')"
The wish to be able to fly is to be understood as nothing else than a longing to be capable of sexual performance.,Sigmund Freud,"('debasishmridha', 'freedom', 'quotes')"

"In the long run, nothing can withstand reason and experience, and the contradiction religion offers to both is palpable.",Sigmund Freud,"('belief', 'faith', 'religion')"
No neurotic harbors thoughts of suicide which are not murderous impulses against others redirected upon himself.,Sigmund Freud,"('death', 'humour', 'philosophy')"
"Creativity is an attempt to resolve a conflict generated by unexpressed biological impulses, such that unfulfilled desires are the driving force of the imagination, and they fuel our dreams and daydreams.",Sigmund Freud,"('creativity', 'inspirational', 'writing')"
It is impossible to overlook the extent to which civilization is built upon a renunciation of instinct.,Sigmund Freud,"('history', 'nature', 'war')"
"Against the suffering which may come upon one from human relationships the readiest safeguard is voluntary isolation, keeping oneself aloof from other people. The happiness which can be achieved along this path is, as we see, the happiness of quietness. Against the dreaded external world one can only defend oneself by some kind of turning away from it, if one intends to solve the task by oneself.",Sigmund Freud,"('happiness', 'life', 'love')"
"Once again, only religion can answer the question of the purpose of life. One can hardly be wrong in concluding that the idea of life having a purpose stands and falls with the religious system.",Sigmund Freud,"('life', 'purpose', 'religion')"
"Might we not say that every child at play behaves like a creative writer, in that he creates a world of his own, or, rather, rearranges the things of his world in a new way which pleases him?",Sigmund Freud,"('children', 'creativity', 'world')"
What is characteristic of illusions is that they are derived from human wishes.,Sigmund Freud,"('debasishmridha', 'philosophy', 'reality')"
"One might compare the relation of the ego to the id with that between a rider and his horse. The horse provides the locomotor energy, and the rider has the prerogative of determining the goal and of guiding the movements of his powerful mount towards it. But all too often in the relations between the ego and the id we find a picture of the less ideal situation in which the rider is obliged to guide his horse in the direction in which it itself wants to go.",Sigmund Freud,"('leadership', 'lifequotes', 'successquotes')"
"Life as we find it is too hard for us; it entails too much pain, too many disappointments, impossible tasks. We cannot do without palliative remedies.",Sigmund Freud,"('death', 'inspirational', 'life')"

"Mans most disagreeable habits and idiosyncrasies, his deceit, his cowardice, his lack of reverence, are engendered by his incomplete adjustment to a complicated civilisation. It is the result of the conflict between our instincts and our culture.",Sigmund Freud,"('man', 'men', 'politics')"
"Where id was, there ego shall be.",Sigmund Freud,"('creativity', 'self', 'spiritual')"
"The fateful question for the human species seems to me to be whether and to what extent their cultural development will succeed in mastering the disturbance of their communal life by the human instinct of aggression and self-destruction ... One thing only do I know for certain and that is that man's judgements of value follow directly from his wihes for happiness-that, accordingly, they are an attempt to support his illusions with arguments.",Sigmund Freud,"('happiness', 'humanity', 'nature')"
"The adoption of the required attitude of mind towards ideas that seem to emerge ""of their own free will"" and the abandonment of the critical function that is normally in operation against them seem to be hard of achievement for some people. The ""involuntary thoughts"" are liable to release a most violent resistance, which seeks to prevent their emergence. If we may trust that great poet and philosopher Friedrich Schiller, however, poetic creation must demand an exactly similar attitude.",Sigmund Freud,"('creativity', 'poetry', 'writing')"
"The very emphasis of the commandment: Thou shalt not kill, makes it certain that we are descended from an endlessly long chain of generations of murderers, whose love of murder was in their blood as it is perhaps also in ours.",Sigmund Freud,"('death', 'love', 'religion')"
"Let us consider the polarity of love and hate.... Now, clinical observation shows not only that love is with unexpected regularityaccompanied by hate (ambivalence), and not only that in human relationships hate is frequently a forerunner of love, but also that in many circumstances hate changes into love and love into hate.",Sigmund Freud,"('change', 'life', 'love')"
"The voice of the intellect is soft one, but it does not rest until it has gained a hearing. Ultimately, after endless rebuffs, it succeeds. This is one of the few points in which one may be optimistic about the future of mankind.",Sigmund Freud,"('humanity', 'mind', 'truth')"
"A man like me cannot live without a hobby-horse, a consuming passion - in Schiller's words a tyrant. I have found my tyrant, and in his service I know no limits. My tyrant is psychology. It has always been my distant, beckoning goal and now since I have hit upon the neuroses, it has come so much the nearer.",Sigmund Freud,"('life', 'passion', 'soul')"
"The primitive stages can always be re-established; the primitive mind is, in the fullest meaning of the word, imperishable.",Sigmund Freud,"('freedom', 'leadership', 'science')"
"The gods retain their threefold task: they must exorcize the terrors of nature, they must reconcile men to the cruelty of Fate, particularly as it is shown in death, and they must compensate them for the sufferings and privations which a civilized life in common has imposed on them.",Sigmund Freud,"('beauty', 'god', 'religion')"
"Experience teaches that for most people there is a limit beyond which their constitution cannot comply with the demands of civilization. All who wish to reach a higher standard than their constitution will allow, fall victims to neurosis. It would have been better for them if they could have remained less ""perfect"".",Sigmund Freud,"('reality', 'religion', 'world')"
"But the repressed merges into the id as well, and is merely a part of it. The repressed is only cut off sharply from the ego by the resistances of repression; it can communicate with the ego through the id.",Sigmund Freud,"('creativity', 'fantasy', 'people')"
"It is a mistake to believe that science consists in nothing but conclusively proved propositions, and it is unjust to demand that it should. It is a demand made by those who feel a craving for authority in some form to replace the religious catechism by something else, even a scientific one.",Sigmund Freud,"('religion', 'science', 'truth')"
It might be said of psychoanalysis that if you give it your little finger it will soon have your whole hand.,Sigmund Freud,"('humor', 'love', 'philosophy')"
"The transformation of object-libido into narcissistic libido which thus takes place obviously implies an abandonment of sexual aims, a desexualization - a kind of sublimation, therefore.",Sigmund Freud,"('change', 'love', 'sex')"
"When it happens that a person has to give up a sexual object, there quite often ensues an alteration of his ego which can only be described as a setting up of the object inside the ego, as it occurs in melancholia; the exact nature of this substitution is as yet unknown to us.",Sigmund Freud,"('change', 'love', 'sex')"
"The whole thing [religion] is so patently infantile, so foreign to reality, that to anyone with a friendly attitude to humanity it is painful to think that the great majority of mortals will never be able to rise above this view of life.",Sigmund Freud,"('life', 'religion', 'spirituality')"
"One thing only do I know for certain and that is that man's judgments of value follow directly his wishes for happiness-that, accordingly, they are an attempt to support his illusions with arguments. [p.111]",Sigmund Freud,"('happiness', 'knowledge', 'man')"
"As regards intellectual work it remains a fact, indeed, that great decisions in the realm of thought and momentous discoveries and solutions of problems are only possible to an individual, working in solitude.",Sigmund Freud,"('power', 'success', 'work')"

The conscious mind may be compared to a fountain playing in the sun and falling back into the great subterranean pool of subconscious from which it rises.,Sigmund Freud,"('mind', 'philosophy', 'spirituality')"

The facts which have caused us to believe in the dominance of the pleasure principle in mental life also find expression in the hypothesis that the mental apparatus endeavours to keep the quantity of excitation present in it as low as possible or at least to keep it constant.,Sigmund Freud,"('happiness', 'science', 'sex')"
"Incidentally, why was it that none of all the pious ever discovered psycho-analysis? Why did it have to wait for a completely godless Jew?",Sigmund Freud,"('history', 'religion', 'science')"
"The impression forces itself upon one that men measure by false standards, that everyone seeks power, success, riches for himself, and admires others who attain them, while undervaluing the truly precious thing in life.",Sigmund Freud,"('history', 'men', 'truth')"
"One must not be mean with affections; what is spent of the funds is renewed in the spending itself. Left untouched for too long, they diminish imperceptibly or the lock gets rusty; they are there all right but one cannot make use of them.",Sigmund Freud,"('marriage', 'money', 'women')"
"The pleasure of satisfying a savage instinct, undomesticated by the ego, is uncomparably much more intense than the one of satisfying a tamed instinct. The reason is becoming the enemy that prevents us from a lot of possibilities of pleasure.",Sigmund Freud,"('love', 'religion', 'sex')"
"No other technique for the conduct of life attaches the individual so firmly to reality as laying emphasis on work; for his work at least gives him a secure place in a portion of reality, in the human community. The possibility it offers of displacing a large amount of libidinal components, whether narcissistic, aggressive or even erotic, on to professional work and on to the human relations connected with it lends it a value by no means second to what it enjoys as something indispensable to the preservation and justification of existence in society.",Sigmund Freud,"('life', 'sex', 'work')"
This is one race of people for whom psychoanalysis is of no use whatsoever.,Sigmund Freud,"('people', 'reality', 'science')"
Religious illusion must bow to scientific truth. It is in total error about the nature of the true world. Only science is not an illusion.,Sigmund Freud,"('religion', 'science', 'truth')"
"Civilization is a process in the service of Eros, whose purpose is to combine single human individuals, and after that families, then races, peoples and nations, into one great unity, the unity of mankind.

"When we attempt to imagine death, we perceive ourselves as spectators.",Sigmund Freud,"('belief', 'death', 'life')"
"A religion, even if it calls itself a religion of love, must be hard and unloving to those who do not belong to it.",Sigmund Freud,"('faith', 'love', 'religion')"
"Just as a satisfaction of instinct spells happiness for us, so severe suffering is caused us if the external world lets us starve, if it refuses to sate our needs. One may therefore hope to be freed from a part of one's sufferings by influencing the instinctual impulses.",Sigmund Freud,"('happiness', 'love', 'pain')"
Illusions commend themselves to us because they save us pain and allow us to enjoy pleasure instead. We must therefore accept it without complaint when they sometimes collide with a bit of reality against which they are dashed to pieces.,Sigmund Freud,"('art', 'debasishmridha', 'reality')"
"The individual does actually carry on a double existence: one designed to serve his own purposes and another as a link in a chain, in which he serves against, or at any rate without, any volition of his own.",Sigmund Freud,"('humanity', 'leadership', 'spiritual')"
"The state in which the ideas existed before being made conscious is called by us repression, and we assert that the force which instituted the repression and maintains it is perceived as resistance during the work of analysis.",Sigmund Freud,"('freedom', 'history', 'science')"

Opposition is not necessarily enmity.,Sigmund Freud,"('inspirational', 'politics', 'quotes')"

"Writers write for fame, wealth, power and the love of women.",Sigmund Freud,"('books', 'women', 'writing')"
"We may insist as often as we like that man's intellect is powerless in comparison to his instinctual life, and we may be right in this. Nevertheless, there is something peculiar about this weakness.

Finally, after a countless succession of rebuffs, it succeeds.",Sigmund Freud,"('humanity', 'intelligence', 'man')"
The world is no nursery.,Sigmund Freud,"('children', 'humor', 'world')"
"Men have gained control over the forces of nature to such an extent that with their help they would have no difficulty exterminating one another to the last man. They know this, and hence comes a large part of their current unrest, their unhappiness and their mood of anxiety.",Sigmund Freud,"('fear', 'men', 'women')"

"Long ago man formed an ideal conception of omnipotence and omniscience which he embodied in his gods. Whatever seemed unattainable to his desires - or forbidden to him - he attributed to these gods... Now he has himself approached very near to realizing this ideal, he has nearly become a god himself.",Sigmund Freud,"('god', 'man', 'religion')"
"A love that does not discriminate seems to me to forfeit a part of its own value, by doing an injustice to its object; and secondly, not all men are worthy of love.",Sigmund Freud,"('love', 'lovequotes', 'religion')"
"It must be pointed out, however, that strictly speaking it is incorrect to talk of the dominance of the pleasure principle over the course of mental processes. If such a dominance existed, the immense majority of our mental processes would have to be accompanied by pleasure or to lead to pleasure, whereas universal experience completely contradicts any such conclusion.",Sigmund Freud,"('joy', 'religion', 'science')"

"Our knowledge of the historical worth of certain religious doctrines increases our respect for them, but does not invalidate our proposal that they should cease to be put forward as the reasons for the precepts of civilization. On the contrary! Those historical residues have helped us to view religious teachings, as it were, as neurotic relics, and we may now argue that the time has probably come, as it does in an analytic treatment, for replacing the effects of repression by the results of the rational operation of the intellect.",Sigmund Freud,"('history', 'religion', 'science')"
"Thinking in pictures is, therefore, only a very incomplete form of becoming conscious. In some way, too, it stands nearer to unconscious processes than does thinking in words, and it is unquestionably older than the latter both ontogenetically and phylogenetically.",Sigmund Freud,"('life', 'mind', 'science')"
"A strong egoism is a protection against disease, but in the last resort we must begin to love in order that we may not fall ill, and must fall ill if, in consequence of frustration, we cannot love.",Sigmund Freud,"('love', 'politics', 'strength')"

"The view is often defended that sciences should be built up on clear and sharply defined basal concepts. In actual fact no science, not even the most exact, begins with such definitions.

"It is no wonder if, under the pressure of these possibilities of suffering, men are accustomed to moderate their claims to happiness - just as the pleasure principle itself, indeed, under the influence of the external world, changed into the more modest reality principle -, if a man thinks himself happy merely to have escaped unhappiness or to have survived his suffering, and if in general the task of avoiding suffering pushes that of obtaining pleasure into the background.",Sigmund Freud,"('happiness', 'joy', 'men')"

Thus we arrive at the singular conclusion that of all the information passed by our cultural assets it is precisely the elements which might be of the greatest importance to us and which have the task of solving the riddles of the universe and of reconciling us to the sufferings of life -- it is precisely those elements that are the least well authenticated of any.,Sigmund Freud,"('life', 'science', 'truth')"

I have no concern with any economic criticisms of the communist system; I cannot inquire into whether the abolition of private property is expedient or advantageous.
